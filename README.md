# ALU
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a core component of any digital processing system, particularly in CPUs and microcontrollers. 
It performs all arithmetic and logical operations required by the processor. 
In this Verilog implementation, the ALU takes two 32-bit inputs and performs operations based on a control signal (alu_op). 
This modular design allows the ALU to be reused across various processor architectures, like RISC or MIPS.
